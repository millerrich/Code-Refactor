# Code Refactoring for Search Engine Optimization

## Description

Code refactoring refers to the process of editing and cleaning up already  
written code without changing how the code functions.  
This has the result of creating more efficient and maintainable code.  
The goal of code refactoring is to meet website accessibilty standards.

The current code for the Horiseon website is perfectly functional,  
however, it could be optimized for search engines.  
The purpose of Search Engine Optimization  
(or SEO) is to increase both the quantity and quality of a website's traffic.
